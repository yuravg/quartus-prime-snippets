// Integer Type Declaration
// Built-in integer vector types.  By default, these types
// are signed.  You can explicitly declare them as unsigned or
// signed by adding the appropriate keyword after the type.
// These types have implicit bounds of [Size - 1 : 0].  2-state
// types support the bit values of {0,1}. 4-state types support
// {0,1,X,Z}.  If you assign a value of X or Z to a 2-state
// type, the value will be treated as 0.

// Built-in integer atom types.  You can use them to declare
// signed or unsigned vectors of arbitrary size.  By default,
// these types are unsigned unless you explicitly declare them
