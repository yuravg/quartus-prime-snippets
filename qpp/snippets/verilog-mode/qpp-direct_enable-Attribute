// direct_enable Attribute
// Identifies the logic cone that should be used as the clock enable
// for a register.  Sometimes a register has a complex clock enable
// condition, which may or may not contain the critical path in your
// design.  With this attribute, you can force Quartus Prime to route
// the critical portion directly to the clock enable port of a register
// and implement the remaining clock enable condition using regular
// logic.

(* direct_enable *) <variable_or_net_declaration>;

// Example
(* direct_enable *) variable e1;
reg e2;
reg q, data;

always@(posedge clk)
begin
	if(e1 | e2)
	begin
		q <= data;
	end
end
