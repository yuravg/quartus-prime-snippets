// direct_enable Attribute
-- Identifies the logic cone that should be used as the clock enable
-- for a register.  Sometimes a register has a complex clock enable
-- condition, which may or may not contain the critical path in your
-- design.  With this attribute, you can force Quartus Prime to route
-- the critical portion directly to the clock enable port of a register
-- and implement the remaining clock enable condition using regular
-- logic.

-- Declare the attribute or import its declaration from
-- altera.altera_syn_attributes
attribute direct_enable : boolean;

attribute direct_enable of <object> : <object_class> is true;

-- Example
signal e1, e2, q, data : std_logic;

attribute direct_enable of e1 : signal is true;

process(clk)
begin
	if(rising_edge(clk) and (e1 or e2)) then
		q <= data;
	end if;
end
