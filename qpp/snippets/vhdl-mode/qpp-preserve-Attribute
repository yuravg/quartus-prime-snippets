// preserve Attribute
-- Prevents Quartus Prime from optimizing away a register as well
-- as from being retimed.  For HyperFlex architectures, users may want
-- "preserve_syn_only", which does allow retiming.
-- Apply the attribute to the variable declaration for an object that infers
-- a register.

-- Declare the attribute or import its declaration from
-- altera.altera_syn_attributes
