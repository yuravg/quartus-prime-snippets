// Anonymous blocks may not include declarations according to
// the Verilog-2001 standard, which states that they do not define
// a new scope.  However, Quartus Prime does create scopes for anonymous blocks
// and allows declarations at the beginning.  The declared objects cannot
// be referenced from outside the block.  Not all tools support this
// non-standard Verilog behavior, but it is available a standard feature
// in SystemVerilog.
