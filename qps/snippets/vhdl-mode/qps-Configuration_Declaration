-- A configuration can control how the various parts of a design fit
-- together.  It can specify which architecture is used with a given
-- entity.  It can select the entity (and architecture) corresponding
-- to a component instantiation.   It can control how the ports and
-- generics of a component map to the ports and generics of the entity
-- it instantiates.

configuration <configuration_name> of <entity_name> is
	for <architecture_name>

		-- Use Clause (optional)

		-- Block Configuration or Component Configuration (optional)

	end for;
end <configuration_name>;


-- Note: A configuration declaration is used to configure one or more
-- instances of an entity.  Quartus Prime must be able to determine which
-- instance(s) to configure, or it will ignore the configuration declaration.
-- Quartus Prime is able to determine which instances to configure in the
-- following cases:
-- 1. The configuration declaration pertains to the top-level entity.
-- 2. The configuration declaration is named in a component configuration
--    that is inside another, higher-level configuration declaration.
-- 3. The configuration declaration is named in a configuration specification.
