// Using Synthesis Attributes
-- Before using an attribute, you must first declare it or import
-- its declaration from a package.  All Altera-supported attributes are
-- declared in the altera_syn_attributes package in the altera library.  You
-- can import these declarations with the following use clause:
use altera.altera_syn_attributes.all;

-- For more detailed information on any attribute, refer to the
-- Quartus Prime Handbook or Help.
